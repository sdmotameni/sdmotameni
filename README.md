### Hey there 👋
## I'm Sep, Full Stack Engineer from  Charlotte, NC.

💡  I like to explore new trends and learn new technologies.
🌱  I'm on track for learning more about React, Context, TypeScript, NextJS, and NodeJS.
🚧  I'm currently working on two new secret projects after DataRest and EasyAuth ... 👀.
💬  Feel free to reach out to me for consulting, volunteering or just for some interesting discussion.
